{"name": "smoothStepper", "title": "Simple Smooth Stepper Motor Motion Control", "abstract": "<p><strong>Stepper motors can produce very high torque, but without profiling and smooth control they can produce significant vibrations, and strain. Using piecewise polynomial profiles can greatly elevate these problems without incurring much additional overhead. Here we provided a simple profiling and code generation system to quickly design programable position, velocity, and torque profiles for a simple stepper-pulley-belt-spring system.</strong></p>\n"}
