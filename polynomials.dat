# Velocity profiles defined by specifying the extrema, that is by
# giving the roots of its derivative.
#
# The sign of the poly is that of the first root given.
#
# Values in this table are ALL 'X' values
#
# The loc-min and loc-max give the X values to use as to find the 
# polynomial's min and max values to normalize to 0 and 1. A none-numeric
# value in either colomn causes the code to find the min or max value
# at one of the roots given.


# Colomns :
# name, loc-min, loc-max, root1, root2, root3, ...
