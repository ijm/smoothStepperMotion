Simple Smooth Stepper Motor Motion Control from polynomial profiles

> "The context and impetus for this project and white paper was a
  friend's custom 3D printed CNC tool which used a single stepper
  motor with a pulley and belt, similar to the configuration in many
  3D printers, and a sprung loaded tool to perform a repetitive
  move-and-part tool motion. Unfortunately they weren't able to find
  a suitably sized stepper motor that was both powerful enough to
  perform the full motion flawlessly but small enough to not vibrate
  the printed chassis to pieces. The project also had a pretty
  underwhelming controller meaning any code solution needed to be
  very tight."

This code generates the combined smoothStepper.pdf file. 

Prerequisits are Python3, Lyx, and pdflatex.

## Comments
At some point this code really ought to be refactored to be more modular
and work with other physical configurations. It's a need-to-get-this-finished mess.
